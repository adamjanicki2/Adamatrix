Adamatrix Description:

This is a work-in-progress Python class/library for matrices. I thought this would
be a fun project to make that applies everything I've learned so far in 18.06.
The goal is to support the following operations on matrices (although some may not be implemented currently):
1. addition/subtraction
2. multiplication
3. elimination
4. determinant
5. transpose
6. inverse
7. eigenvalues
